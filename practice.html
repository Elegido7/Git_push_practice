      <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
      <p>
          In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents.
          These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text,
          paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to
          distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles —
          very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically
          readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.
      </p>
      <h2>What is CSS for?</h2>
      <p>
          As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users —
          how they are styled, laid out, etc. A document is usually a text file structured using a markup
          language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup
          languages such as SVG or XML. Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable
          by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents
          visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.
